Lora network packet forwarder project
======================================

1. Core program: basic_pkt_fwt
-------------------------------

The basic packet forwarder is a program running on the host of a Lora Gateway 
that forward RF packets receive by the concentrator to a server through a 
IP/UDP link, and emits RF packets that are sent by the server.

Uplink: radio packets received by the gateway, with metadata added by the
gateway, forwarded to the server. Might also include gateway status.

Downlink: packets generated by the server, with additional metadata, to be
transmitted by the gateway on the radio channel. Might also include
configuration data for the gateway.

2. Helper programs
-------------------

Those programs are included in the project to provide examples on how to 
communicate with the packet forwarder, and to help the system builder use it 
without having to implement a full Lora network server.

### 2.1. util_sink ###

The packet sink is a simple helper program listening on a single port for UDP 
datagrams, and displaying a message each time one is received. The content of 
the datagram itself is ignored.

### 2.2. util_ack ###

The packet acknowledger is a simple helper program listening on a single UDP 
port and responding to PUSH_DATA datagrams with PUSH_ACK, and to PULL_DATA 
datagrams with PULL_ACK.

### 2.3. util_tx_test ###

The network packet sender is a simple helper program used to send packets 
through the gateway-to-server downlink route.

3. Changelog
-------------

v1.1.0 - 2013-12-09

* Feature: added packet filtering parameters to the JSON configuration files.
* Bugfix: won't send a datagram if all the packets returned by the receive()
function have been filtered out.
* Bugfix: removed leading zeros for the timestamp in the upstream JSON because
it's not compliant with JSON standard (might be interpreted as octal number).
* Removed TXT extension for README files for better Github integration.
* Cleaned-up documentation, moving change log to top README.
* Modified Makefiles to ease cross-compilation.

v1.0.0 - 2013-11-22

* Initial release of the packet forwarder, protocol specifications and helper
programs.
