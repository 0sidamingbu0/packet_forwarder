Utility: packet sink
=====================

1. Introduction
----------------

The packet sink is a simple helper program listening on a single port for UDP 
datagrams, and displaying a message each time one is received. The content of 
the datagram itself is ignored.

This allow to test another software (locally or on another computer) that 
sends UDP datagrams without having ICMP 'port closed' errors each time.

2. Dependencies
----------------

None.

3. Usage
---------

Start the program with the port number as first and only argument.

To stop the application, press Ctrl+C.
